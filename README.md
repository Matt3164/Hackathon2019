# Hackathon2019
ISAE-SUPAERO Hackathon based on image location retrieval

# Data
As explained during the presentation, you will work with Sentinel-2 image time series. The data is provided in [tfrecord format](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tf_records) which is a useful format when dealing with large amounts of data. For training your models, we selected 42 tiles containing several regions of interest such as the Amazon rainforest, the Dead Sea, the city of Los Angeles, the Great Sandy Desert, circular fields in Saudi Arabia, among others.

For each tile, we extracted 100 time series composed of 12 images of size 512 x 512 x 4 and saved them in a tfrecord file.
